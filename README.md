# Microservices architecture

Some material and studies around the microservices architecture.
Since I am currently studying within an Udemy course, so I will be updating this in the pace I am progressing.

If you want some more information about that, please find the related materials below:

 * [UDEMY Course] - Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud 
* [in28minutes Github] - spring-microservices repo with all the course code

It is important to say that I am not involved with in28minutes or anything related to their course, but indeed it is an awesome course and they deserve all the credit :)
