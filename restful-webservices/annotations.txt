* Richardson Maturity Model

	1) Level 1 - Exposing SOAP Services in REST style
	2) Level 2 - Start to think about resources, but using the wrong HTTP methods
	3) Level 3 - Use the correct HTTP methods, and apply HATEOS (next actions) to your resources

* Best practices

	1) Think about the consumer
		- Simple names help your customer to find the appropriate resource to use
		- Provide a rich documentation about what your services do, and how to use then properly
	2) Make the best use of the HTTP Methods
		- Use the correct methods (DELETE, PUT, POST, GET...)
	3) Send the properly response status to your customer
		- Do not send just 200 (Success) to every operation, send 201 (Created) for example
			- Unauthorized, server error, resource not found, bad request...
	4) Think about what you are going to put in your resource
		- Pay attention to not use any kind of sensitive information in the URIs 
	5) Use plurals
		- Prefer /users to /user
			- /users/1 to /user/1
	6) Use nous for resources
		- Use /users instead of /deleteUsers
		* There are some exceptions of course :) The best way is to sit and define a consistent approach to move on with
			- You can use like /users/search
			- PUT /gists/{id}/star
			- DELETE /gists/{id}/star
